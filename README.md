# Neoware Eon/CA2 PISA to ISA/PCI Riser Card

![Product Image](./pcb.jpg)

An exact 1:1 reproduction of the original riser card used in Neoware Eon/CA2 systems. This riser card enables the conversion of PISA to ISA and PCI.

## Features

- **Function**: Converts PISA to ISA & PCI
- **Voltage Converter**: I added an integrated -5V voltage converter for the ISA slot
- **Condition**: New, 1:1 reproduction of the original card (except for the -5V voltage converter)
- **Compatibility**: Identical to the card installed in Neoware Eon/CA2
